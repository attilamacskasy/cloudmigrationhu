# Hyper-V Toggle Scripts for VMware Workstation

These scripts help you **switch between VMware Workstation** (with full native hardware access) and **Microsoft Hyper-V / VBS security features** on Windows 11.

On modern CPUs, Windows 11 enables **Hyper-V**, **Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)**, and **Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI)** by default.  
This causes VMware Workstation (and sometimes VirtualBox) to run on top of the **Windows Hypervisor Platform**, which reduces performance and compatibility.

These scripts let you toggle between the two worlds:

- **Disable-HyperV-For-Workstation.ps1** â†’ Best performance for VMware Workstation  
- **Enable-HyperV-For-Workstation.ps1** â†’ Restore Hyper-V and Windows security features
