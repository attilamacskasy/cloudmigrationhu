.SYNOPSIS
    Re-enables Hyper-V, Windows Hypervisor Platform, Virtual Machine Platform,
    Windows Sandbox, and Virtualization-Based Security (VBS/HVCI) after they
    were disabled for VMware Workstation performance.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script restores Microsoftâ€™s virtualization stack and security features:
        - Hyper-V and related services
        - Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHP)
        - Virtual Machine Platform (VMP)
        - Windows Sandbox
        - Device Guard / Credential Guard
        - VBS / HVCI (Memory Integrity)

    It also sets the boot configuration so the Hyper-V hypervisor launches again.

.NOTES
