1. **00_Automated_Script_Launcher.ps1**

   *Description*: This script serves as a centralized orchestrator, designed to sequentially execute a series of migration-related scripts in a predefined order. It ensures that each step of the migration process is carried out systematically, reducing the potential for human error and streamlining the overall workflow.

   *Functionality*: Upon execution, the script:

   - Defines the sequence of scripts to be run, typically corresponding to various stages of the process.
   - Initiates each script in the specified order, monitoring their execution status.
   - Logs the outcome of each script, capturing success or failure states and any pertinent output messages.
   - Implements error-handling mechanisms to halt the process if a critical script fails, ensuring that subsequent steps are not executed under faulty conditions.

   *Importance*: By utilizing this automated launcher, organizations can ensure a consistent and repeatable deployment process. It minimizes manual intervention, reduces the likelihood of missed steps or misconfigurations, and provides a clear audit trail of the migration activities. This approach enhances efficiency, accountability, and overall success rates in cloud migration projects.

   *Next steps*: In the future, this will evolve into a sleek, modern DevOps pipeline capable of redeploying the entire LAB with ease. However, due to the unique nature of this setup—built on Hyper-V, Synology, and Mikrotik—there are specific networking and hardware requirements that differ from standardized public cloud environments.
